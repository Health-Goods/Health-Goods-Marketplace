This is an ecommerce site that will sell health-related products and supplements. The target audience will be anyone looking to purchase supplements online.

### Goals of this project

### User Roles
Admins are initially the two developers who will be able to login to an admin dashboard and manage inventory of the site, full CRUD of any products, users, reviews, returns, etc.
Customers will be the intended audience and average user of the site. Customers will also have full CRUD for some parts of the site like reviews, their wishlist(Stretch goal), and Cart. They will primarily be browsing and purchasing products from the site.
